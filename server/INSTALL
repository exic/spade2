You can choose to install both tlslite and xmpppy or you can install nothing.
If you will not install anything, do:
    tar xzf tlslite-0.3.5.tar.gz
    ln -s ../tlslite/tlslite-0.3.5/tlslite xmppd
so the xmppd will be able to find it.

=============tlslite module installation=========

You will need to install tlslite module prior to running xmppd.py .

I have included tlslite tarball in this package and using it myself.
This is not guarantees though that it is good [enough] or that it is not troyaned or 
didn't contain any malicious code. I've just grabbed it and installed it blindly on
my machine.
If you don't like such way - just pull the TLS module out of xmppd - you can do it by 
killing one line from modules/__init__.py and removing the according "import" line from
modules/stream.py

If you decided nevertheless to install it - it is simple:
just do "setup.py install" from the root shell and you'll be done with that.

========== xmpppy library ===========
You can also install xmpppy library. This step is similar to previous:
run "setup.py install" from the root shell.
Or you can just leave it alone - symlink is already in place and the things will work "as is".
